# `todo` - A smarter way to organise your to-do lists

`todo` is a tool that allows you to easily manage your to-do lists. At the current stage `todo` provides a command line interface (CLI) from which you can add, remove and update tasks in your to-do list.

`todo` aims to simplify the maintainance of your to-do lists, encapsulating the logic behind moving a task from a list to the other, based on the proximity of the deadline. For instance, you could organise your lists into High Impact Tasks (HIT), Master and Backlog, and assign rules based on the deadline proximity to move around tasks among the lists.
