# todo - A TODO lists manager that moves tasks from one list to the other basedon recency

*todo* is a tool that lets you manage your TODO lists and sync them with popular apps like Evernote. *todo* provides a command line interface (CLI) which you can use to add, remove and update events in your list. These events will then be synched with a SQLite3 database locally and then in Evernote. *todo* also regularly checks for updates on the apps you synched (for instance you might have had ticked a box next to an item) and updates the same item in your local database in order to maintain your items up-to-date on all interfaces. 

*todo* aims to be your only TODO lists manager and offers you the flexibility of using some of the most popular tools out there to communicate with it, when you can't access the CLI.
